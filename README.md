# fantasy_premier_league

Repository for Fantasy Premier League data ETL code. Very much a work in progress.

End goals:
* ETL of data available from official FPL API (endpoints beginning with: https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/). Includes loading from API, transforms of data, and loading to postgresql database.
* Predicting players likely to score highly based on historical data using simple machine learning methods - **future**
* Creation of a dashboard/web interface to show player data including results of ML models - **future**

Currently developing everything locally but looking to move to (cheap) cloud-based infrastructure to host database and dashboard/web-app.

This is a personal project so I don't claim everything to be correct or fully robust, at least to start with!
